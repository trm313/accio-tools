# How to Use Color Shades Generator

Use the input field to enter a color value. We support all color forms: hex, RGB, RGBA, HSL, HSV, and via color name (eg. gray).

Alternatively, click on the color box to open the color picker, and find a color that you like there! 

Once selected, we'll automatically generate 10 shades based on that color. When you have what you like, check out the different code formatting tabs to easily copy and paste the shade pallette for use in your CSS files, or with frameworks like TailwindCSS. 

Picking beautiful color shades is kind of an art itself, and some tradeoffs have to be made when creating an automated tool for it, but we hope it provides a great starting point that you can always tweak later.
